Team Perseverance will create an on-line version of a study skills inventory for Radford students enrolled in ITEC120 (or Univ100). Students will be able to take the survey and then receive their score indicating areas that require improvement. Quiz info will be stored in a database for later analysis. An administrator can create new questions, or edit existing ones. A sample of the current paper survey can be found at [this url](https://php.radford.edu/~itec325/2017spring-ibarland/Homeworks/Project/inventory-of-college-level-study-skills.pdf).
